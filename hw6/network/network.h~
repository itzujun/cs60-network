//In this lab this thread only broadcasts empty route update packets to all the neighbors, broadcasting is done by set the dest_nodeID in packet header as BROADCAST_NODEID

//this thread handles incoming packets from the ON process
//It receives packets from the ON process by calling overlay_recvpkt()
//In this lab, after receiving a packet, this thread just outputs the packet received information without handling the packet

//this function stops the SNP process 
//it closes all the connections and frees all the dynamically allocated memory
//it is called when the SNP process receives a signal SIGINT
void network_stop();

//This function opens a port on NETWORK_PORT and waits for the TCP connection from local SRT process.
//After the local SRT process is connected, this function keeps receiving sendseg_arg_ts which contains the segments and their destination node addresses from the SRT process. The received segments are then encapsulated into packets (one segment in one packet), and sent to the next hop using overlay_sendpkt. The next hop is retrieved from routing table.
//When a local SRT process is disconnected, this function waits for the next SRT process to connect.
